# TODOs

## Logic
- decide whether Player or Game handles navigation (or another object)
- implement Room generator (static maybe? random game object generator?)
- Turn needs to be renamed and repurposed
---

## UI
- implement TextRenderer methods for player text info
- add InputHandler class for asking the player questions
