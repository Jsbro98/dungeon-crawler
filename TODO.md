# TODOs

## Logic
- decide whether Player or Game handles navigation (or another object)
- implement Room generator (static maybe? random game object generator?)
- Turn needs to be renamed and repurposed
- implement DamageStrategy for classes (or compose a object for it)
- add Spawner class for entity creation
---

## UI
- implement TextRenderer methods for player text info
- should InputHandler live in TextRenderer?
---

## World
- add new enemies
- add new Items
